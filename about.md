My name is Pranay and this blog is my whiteboard for all sorts of stuff I like to read or think about. I am currently an Undergrad student interested in *Natural Language Processing and Linguistics*. I am currently working on *Applications of Deep Learning to Cognitive Neuroscience* and other related fields. In my free time I like to dabble with Cybersecurity and Progressive Music.
