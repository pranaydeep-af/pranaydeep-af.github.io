The class stared at me in awe as I switched to the slide with the diffraction pattern. I heard a collective murmur.

“Surprising? Imagine what scientists at the time thought of this.” I said. Still not a word. Everyone still trying to figure out what had happened there. 

“This is still considered to be one of the most baffling moments in experimental physics.” I said. 

I felt like a magician revealing a man after I had supposedly made him disappear. Even though the trick wasn’t mine, I felt quite proud of it. Now it was time for the even more fun part. Revealing how the trick was performed. 

“So. Time for a little bit of an explanation.” I said.

“Sir, you are talking weirdly. I can’t understand.” A boy in the front row murmured. The whole class nodded in approval.

“What are you guys talking about?” I said, but the words that came out of my mouth were different. Garbled. I tried to think what was happening but my mind seemed clouded. Unable to process. Then the tables and the ground started shaking and it all went dark.

“Dr. Kane? Sir? Are you feeling better?” a voice said. I did not know who that was. I was in a bed. A comfortable one. The air smelled nice, but artificial. My feet were chilly. I tried to open my eyes but they seemed like they had weights on them. After a lot of effort, a flurry of white light flooded my face. I groaned.

“It’s alright, Sir. You are alright now. You can relax.” the voice said softly again. It was a girl’s voice. As my pupils adjusted to the light, I realized I was in an emergency room. Everything around was white. Lights, sheets, curtains, clothes. It was almost too much white to look at. I wondered why hospitals loved white. It sure would be pretty hard to clean. Maybe, it was because of the brightness. To make dimming lives seem like they are still bright. I looked to the left and saw a nurse looking at me intently. Awaiting my response patiently.

“I am alright. But what happened?” I managed with a slippery tongue. My words still seemed like they were coming out of a child’s mouth. My legs and hands seemed weak. I felt like I was just waking up after a 10 mile run. 

“Sir, you passed out during your class. Your students called 911. You are in St. Mungo’s Hospital. We did some basic blood tests. Everything looks fine for now. Your wife and daughter are waiting to take you home in the lounge.” she said. It took me a few seconds to process all the information. Lily and Emma were waiting. They couldn’t be too excited considering this was the 3rd time in the last month they were picking me up at a hospital.

The nurse helped me get up. My back seemed very fragile. Like it had been carrying a lot of weight lately. I looked around to see all kinds of people in trouble. A man with a gunshot wound on his shoulder, a woman in labor, a boy who probably had an overdose episode. I felt like the odd one out. Like the richest man in the room everyone envies. My wealth was that all my limbs were fine. “Just a little weakness”, I told myself. Was it just a little weakness though? This has been the 3rd blackout. It’s probably just old age starting to take over. I was past 40 now after all.

I showed up in the lounge after signing up a few papers and getting my clothes back. Emma and Lily sat in a sofa solving a crossword together. “Buckle up old man, you have to start eating healthier now.” Emma chuckled.

“This is it. Doctor’s appointment. Today.” Lily said with a strict firmness. I groaned. “No, I am fine. I didn’t have breakfast today. I don’t want to see the doctor.” I said. I felt like an 8 year old afraid of injections. But I had my reasons. I hate hospitals and doctors. I taught Theoretical Physics in an university. I had lived my whole life explaining to people how wondrous this universe and this life is. Hospitals constantly were a reminder of the fact that it had its flaws. A temple of negativity.

“I have already spoken to the receptionist. We have an appointment. In 10 minutes.” She smiled wickedly. “Okay, but this is it. Once I am checked out, you dare not try to get me back again.” I said. “We’ll see about that.” she said.

I sat back in the sofa comfortably. I couldn’t help but look around again. A woman in her twenties, sobbing. Another old woman, attached to a cylinder, looking miserable. A man with one foot, on a crutch. It felt like a human museum of accidents, mistakes and misery. I wanted to be out of there as fast as I could.

But 5 days later there I was, back again. Staring at my reports in amazement. “ALS - Primary diagnosis” it said in the note at the end. ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. My nerves were degenerating, my muscles collapsing. I had 10-15 days to live. My mind started to wander as I realized I had become a piece in the museum.

“I am so sorry. As I said. We will do everything we can to reduce your pain. Please sit down.” The doctor said calmly as if informing me that my pizza had arrived. He would have delivered that same news 3 times a day. It wasn’t a big deal for him. He was the janitor of the museum. The displays weren’t shocking anymore because he saw them everyday. But the people who visited the museum for the first time. They are the ones who are shocked and amazed. Like families. My family. Lily and Emma. I felt sorry for them. But not for me. I was alright. I am a man of science. If anything, I can handle death.

Over the next few days, I was comfortably placed in a room, with a TV. For some reason, the hospital assumed I would like to spend my last few days looking at soap operas and football matches. Lily and Emma were there. All the time. It was hard for them. Emma had been bunking college and Lily had taken leave. A bunch of flowers had been assembled by my nightstand from co-workers and students. Love to Ethan, they said. I didn’t know their names. Not one. Yet, they say they send love. How close death makes us feel. We feel sad for the people we never knew. Like those museum pieces we stare at so intently. Visitors pecked against the glass. Oh, that old man has Alzheimer’s. How sad. Oh, the lady has cancer, how devastating. 

“So, yeah, we finally put out the small fires all round the room. Man, the prof was pissed.” Emma finished her story, as I drifted back into the real world. “Dad, where you even listening?” she said annoyed.

“Of course I was sweetie. You should focus more on studying though.” I said.

“I am. Don’t worry. I will be the best lawyer, ever.” she gleamed.

“I am sure you will.” I smiled back.

I had 2 more days according to the doctor’s predictions on the disease progression. My vision was blurry now. I know it  sounds sick. But I wasn’t sad or anything. For 20 years, I had been studying and teaching science. Believing that we control our fate. Not some crazy man with a beard, called God. In two days, I would find out. What will I see when I die? My life flashing by? A door and a stairway with light? I was eager to find out. It wasn’t just that. I never really thought about it much, but I was bored. Exhausted of going to college daily and talking like a robot for hours at stretch. Teaching students who never comprehend the magnitude of the things I said. I was tired. Of people not understanding me. I wanted to move on. I was gonna be the most content man dying, ever. Lily was broken though. She never looked me in the eye after the diagnosis. She couldn’t bear to believe what was about to happen. I tried not to remind her. The result was a stringent denial of the state of events. Emma was dealing with it well. She stayed with me all the time. Helped me out with food and walking. I told her a few things that would be important to her. She cried a few times, but she carried herself well. Occasionally a few students and co-workers would come to visit. They never stayed for more than 5 minutes though. 

With just 2 days left, today was going to be my day out. Emma and Lily planned to take me to a cliff overseeing the lake. I was excited. I would take it all in for the last time. Then, be ready to face whatever comes next. A lot of pain for 2 days. But hopefully, whatever comes after would be worth it. My encounter with the afterlife. In the museum of misery, I would move on from the i-pity-them sick people display, to the he-was-a-good-man dead display.

I was stuffed into the back of a car with my wheelchair in the trunk. Lots of bottles attached to me. Lily was driving, Emma sat next to me, holding onto my hand. It wasn’t a long drive. 10 minutes was all it took, for the scenery to change from the glistening, gloomy white to the color of life. Green. Lush green grass, thick foliage of trees and a neat blue sky. All the things, that should be in hospitals instead of the sickening white. Emma helped me open the window as a cool breeze swept my hair. The smell of water and mud flew in with it. Just 10 minutes away from AIDS, Cancers and Alzheimer's.

Lily stopped driving at the end of a dusty road. Emma got out and pulled the wheel chair of the back as I mustered all my strength to get onto it. As I looked around, I saw a big blue lake towards the edge. We were way above it all. The kids playing, the people diving. Closer to the sky. Emma navigated my wheelchair towards a small garden with a few park benches.

“Did you get the I-Pod?” I asked.

“Of course” she replied.

“Put it on then.” she said.

“Oops, excuse me for a second.” she said as her phone started to buzz in her pockets.

“Don’t worry. You get it. I’ll put it on.” I asked. She handed me the I-Pod and turned to answer the phone. It was hard, but I managed. I thought about the pain that would come tomorrow. It would be like never before. The reality is so near and inevitable for me now. It’s impossible to ignore it.

Lily sat there staring at me intently as I nodded to the music. Over the last week, all life had been drained off her. She was now a shade of yellow. With dark patches under her eyes. Lily and Emma. The only reason I still had a part which wished I could stay. The sun was a shade of orange now. The sky also absorbing it’s orangish tint as if a colored ball in a jar of water. I couldn’t hear anything else except the loud music flooding my ears as a tear streamed down my eye. I was going to die. It just hit me. What if there is no afterlife? What if I was right? Physics was right? No afterlife. Just. The End. And Emma. What would she do without me? Will today be the last time I ever see her. I started to shiver as my eyelids welled up. I was a rational, scientific man. But I broke down. Rationality or irrationality can not explain what I felt then. 

I could hear nothing over the sound of the music. I opened my eyes, Lily’s mouth was wide open. Color flooding to her cheeks as she got up on her feet. I turned around to find Emma jumping up and down. Eyes wide. Screaming. I wondered if she had passed her bar exams. I stopped the song as both of them came towering down on me. Hugging me. My muscles ached. As they pulled away, both of them were welled up with tears.

“It’s all good.” Emma screamed.

“What’s good?” I asked.

“It’s all good. You are all good. Daddy, you are going to be fine.” She said still screaming. Lily still couldn’t talk as she turned away, all teary.

“I don’t get it.” I said, puzzled.

“It was a misdiagnosis. You do not have ALS. It’s PLS. The onset is similar. Doctors make that mistake sometimes. You will have a long, healthy life.” She cried. I looked at her blankly.

“Why are you not happy, Daddy?” she asked jumping up and down.

“Of course, I am honey.” I said. Emma and Lily started calling my sister and her family jumping and hugging. I dragged my wheelchair towards the edge.I looked at the sun again. It was all gone. No more beautiful, gold ball in a jar of water. It was nothing now. Just the sun. The sun that had always been there. The sun I ignored everyday. The sun I was bored of. I could hear a whole lot of screaming in the background. I wanted that sun back again. The one I enjoyed, one I hadn’t been seeing for the past 40 years. I wanted more. 

In one fluid motion, I jerked my wheelchair. The cool breeze swept my face again. Only much harder than before. As I fell, the sun turned to that beautiful ball again. The ground was approaching me at a threatening speed.

I counted back from three. Three. Two.
